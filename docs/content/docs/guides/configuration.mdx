Hyper Connect works out of the box with zero configuration, but you can customize various aspects of the application in the **Settings** page.

## General Settings

### Device Name

By default, the app uses your system's hostname. You can change this to something more recognizable (e.g., "Rajeshwar's MacBook").

### Auto-Launch

Enable this to have Hyper Connect start automatically when you log in to your computer.

## File Sharing

### Download Directory

Choose where received files are saved. By default, they go to your system's `Downloads/HyperConnect` folder.

### Auto-Accept

Toggle whether you want to automatically accept file transfers from known or any devices.

## Network

### Port Selection

The app uses port `5353` for discovery and a dynamic port for data transfer. If you have a specific firewall setup, you can pin the data transfer port here.

<Callout type="idea">
  If you're having trouble connecting, try changing the port to something else like `5000` on both
  devices.

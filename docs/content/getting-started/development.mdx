# Development Workflow

This guide covers the development workflow for HyperConnect, including running the app locally, building for production, and code quality tools.

## Running the Application

### Development Mode

Start the application in development mode with hot-reload:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command:

- Starts the Electron main process
- Launches the React renderer with hot module replacement (HMR)
- Opens the application window automatically

The app will reload automatically when you make changes to the code.

### Preview Mode

To preview the built application without creating distributable packages:

```bash
npm start
```

## Code Quality

### Linting

Run ESLint to check for code quality issues:

```bash
npm run lint
```

ESLint is configured to check:

- TypeScript code in both main and renderer processes
- React best practices and hooks rules
- Code style consistency

### Type Checking

Verify TypeScript types across the entire codebase:

```bash
# Check all types
npm run typecheck

# Check main process only
npm run typecheck:node

# Check renderer process only
npm run typecheck:web
```

### Code Formatting

Format code using Prettier:

```bash
npm run format
```

This will format all files according to the project's Prettier configuration.

## Building for Production

### Build the Application

Compile the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command:

1. Runs type checking for both processes
2. Builds the main process with electron-vite
3. Builds the renderer process with Vite
4. Outputs compiled files to the `out/` directory

### Platform-Specific Builds

Create distributable packages for specific platforms:

```bash
# macOS
npm run build:mac

# Windows
npm run build:win

# Linux
npm run build:linux

# All platforms
npm run build:all
```

The distributable files will be created in the `dist/` directory.

### Unpacked Build

Create an unpacked build for testing without creating installers:

```bash
npm run build:unpack
```

| `npm run build:linux` | Build for Linux                        |

## Development Tips

### Hot Reload

The renderer process supports hot module replacement (HMR). Changes to React components will update instantly without restarting the app.

The main process requires a full restart when modified. The dev server will automatically restart the Electron process.

### Debugging

#### Renderer Process

Open DevTools in the Electron window:

- **macOS**: `Cmd + Option + I`
- **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + Shift + I`

#### Main Process

Use VSCode's built-in debugger or add `console.log()` statements. Logs appear in the terminal where you ran `npm run dev`.

### State Persistence

HyperConnect uses `electron-store` for persistent storage. During development, the store is saved to:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/hyper-connect/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/hyper-connect/`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/hyper-connect/`

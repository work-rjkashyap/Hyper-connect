# Installation

This guide will help you set up HyperConnect for development on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher) - [Download](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn**
- **Git** - [Download](https://git-scm.com/)

### System Requirements

- **macOS**: 10.13 or higher
- **Windows**: Windows 10 or higher
- **Linux**: Ubuntu 18.04 or higher (or equivalent)

## Clone the Repository

First, clone the HyperConnect repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/work-rjkashyap/Hyper-connect.git
cd Hyper-connect
```

## Install Dependencies

Install all required dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install:

- Electron and related tools
- React and TypeScript dependencies
- UI libraries (Radix UI, Tailwind CSS)
- Development tools (ESLint, Prettier)

## Recommended IDE Setup

For the best development experience, we recommend:

### Visual Studio Code

[Download VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

**Recommended Extensions:**

- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) - JavaScript/TypeScript linting
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) - Code formatting
- [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) - Tailwind autocomplete

### Editor Configuration

The project includes `.editorconfig` for consistent coding styles across different editors.

## Verify Installation

To verify everything is set up correctly, run:

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

This command checks TypeScript types for both the main and renderer processes. If it completes without errors, you're ready to start developing!

## Next Steps

Now that you have HyperConnect installed, learn about:

- [Development Workflow](/docs/getting-started/development) - Run and build the application
- [Project Structure](/docs/architecture/project-structure) - Understand the codebase organization

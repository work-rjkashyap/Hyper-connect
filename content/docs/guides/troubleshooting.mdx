If you encounter issues while using Hyper Connect, check the solutions below.

## Device Discovery Issues

### Devices not showing up

- **Same Network**: Ensure both devices are connected to the same local network.
- **Firewall**: Check if your firewall is blocking Hyper Connect. You may need to add an exception.
- **VPN**: Dynamic discovery often fails when a VPN is active. Try disconnecting your VPN.

### "Connection Refused"

This usually happens when the port is being used by another application. Try restarting the app or changing the port in [Configuration](./configuration).

## macOS "Damaged App" Error

If you see a message saying **"Hyper Connect.app" is damaged and can't be opened**, it's often due to macOS Gatekeeper blocking unsigned apps.

<Steps>
  <Step>### Open Terminal Press `Cmd + Space` and type "Terminal".</Step>
  <Step>
    ### Run Quarantine Removal Type the following command and press Enter: ```bash xattr -cr
    /Applications/Hyper\ Connect.app ```
  </Step>
  <Step>### Re-launch Try opening the app again.</Step>
</Steps>

## Slow File Transfers

- **Wi-Fi Signal**: Ensure you have a strong connection.
- **Background Apps**: Other apps using significant bandwidth (like torrents or streaming) may slow down the transfer.
- **Cable is King**: For the fastest speeds, use an Ethernet cable between devices.
